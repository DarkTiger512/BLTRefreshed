# Go to https://twitchtokengenerator.com/quick/rv3hDDw31w to generate an access token then paste it in AccessToken below.
# It will last 60 days, after which you can just generate another one.
#   !!! Keep it secret as it gives write access to channel point rewards (although it can only modify ones it created) !!!
#   !!! If you think it was compromised then go to https://twitchtokengenerator.com and revoke it. !!!
AccessToken: paste your token here
# You can use the same access token for the bot if you want, this means your own account will respond to 
# commands in your chat (with the bot prefix).
# Alternatively if you want a different bot account, then create a new twitch account with the name you want, 
# login to it, then goto https://twitchtokengenerator.com/quick/VKKQSNK5tT to generate a token and paste 
# it below:
BotAccessToken: paste bot token here
# This is the twitchtokengenerator client ID, it shouldn't change
ClientID: "gp762nuuoqcoxypju8c569th9wz7q5"
# This is prefixed on all chat messages sent by the bot
BotMessagePrefix: "░BLT░ "
